In this preview, I am showing you a combination of my pre-cooking ritual sounds before I begin cooking my meal.
I began by recording the sound of my window shades opening, which I always do prior to cooking to let in the natural light. 
While I usually open my kitchen blinds for this step, I didn't think the quiet noise would be distinguishable enough, so I opened my living room shades instead. 
I followed the opening of the window shades with the lighting of a candle, to stimulate a warm and cozy atmosphere. 
While I was recording myself pulling the lighter away from the candle, I accidentally hit the glass with it, making a "ding" like sound. I intentionally kept it in because I thought it made the sound more raw and natural. 
After I lit the candle, I recorded the sound of my phone connecting to my mini speaker,
followed by SZA's "Kill Bill" playing on a low volume in the background.
While you may be able to pick up on the individual sounds of the curtains opening, the candle lighting, the speaker connecting, and the music playing,
the listener may not piece together why those sounds are occurring one after the other.
I like the mysteriousness of the preview for this reason.
Once the cooking begins, which will begin shortly after the music starts, and which will be identifiable by sounds like the heavy pot being placed on the stove,
the gas stove turning on, water boiling, putting pasta in the pot, and chopping vegetables,
the sounds in the preview described above may become more clear. 
If anyone who listens to my preview like to cook, I wonder if they will be able to relate to any of my pre-cooking rituals, like playing music, lighting a candle, or opening the blinds.
